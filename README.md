#AWS RUBY EXAMPLEs

These are ruby examples using the AWS Ruby SDK. 

I noticed there are not many examples out there and Amazon Docs are not super clear.

Hopefully, this helps others see the SDK in action. 

Also this repo is designed to help me learn Ruby because I am a complete Ruby noob and I'm cowboy coding my way through this.
